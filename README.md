# LITA_CAPSTONE_PROJECT
------------------------------------------------
Introduction to the Capstone Project on Data Analysis. 
The Capstone Project is a comprehensive data analysis initiative that uses datasets to extract meaningful insights and drive informed decision-making. This project integrates various data analysis tools and techniques, specifically Excel, SQL, and Power BI, to showcase a holistic data management and visualization approach.

Throughout the project, we will work with diverse datasets that require cleaning, manipulation, and analysis to uncover trends and patterns. Utilizing Excel, we will perform initial data exploration and analysis, applying functions and pivot tables to summarize key findings. 
Next, SQL will be employed for more advanced data querying and management, allowing us to efficiently retrieve and manipulate large datasets from relational databases.

Finally, we will harness the power of Power BI to create interactive visualizations and dashboards that present our findings in a user-friendly format. This will enable stakeholders to engage with the data dynamically, facilitating a deeper understanding of the insights derived from the analysis.
Overall, this Capstone Project aims to enhance our data analysis skills and demonstrate our ability to effectively utilize analytical tools to solve real-world problems, ultimately contributing to data-driven decision-making processes.

### PROJECT 1: SALES PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS FOR A RETAIL STORE
-------------------
In this project, you are tasked with analyzing the sales performance of a retail store. You will need to explore sales data to uncover key insights such as top-selling products, regional performance, and monthly sales trends. The goal is to produce an interactive Power BI dashboard that highlights these findings.

  -  Excel:
     1.  Perform an initial exploration of the sales data. Use pivot tables to summarize total sales by product, region, and month.
     2.   Use Excel formulas to calculate metrics such as average sales per product and total revenue by region.
     3.   Create any other interesting report.

### DATA SOURCES
--------------
The Data sources include the following key points:
   1. ORDER_ID: A unique identifier assigned to each order in a system.
   2. CUSTOMER_ID: A unique identifier for each customer, linking them to specific orders and other relevant customer details.
   3. PRODUCT: The item being purchased in the order, usually described by a name, code, or category.
   4. REGION: The geographical area where the order is placed or delivered.
   5. ORDER DATE: The date the order was placed, providing insight into the timing and frequency of orders.
   6. QUANTITY: The number of units of the product being ordered.
   7. UNIT PRICE: The price of a single unit of the product, which can help calculate the total cost when multiplied by quantity.
      
These datasets collectively provide a comprehensive view of sales performance, customer behavior, and market dynamics, enabling informed decision-making.

### METRICS OF FOCUS
------------------
 - Total Sales By Product: The total revenue generated from each product, calculated by summing up the sales of each product across all orders. This helps identify the best-selling and most profitable products.
 - Total Sales By Region: The total revenue generated within each geographic region, is useful for understanding regional demand and performance.
 - Total Sales By Month: The total revenue generated in each month, providing insights into seasonal trends and monthly sales performance.
 - Average Sales per Product: The average revenue generated by each product, is calculated by dividing the total sales of each product by the number of sales instances. This helps assess the average contribution of each product to 
     revenue.
  - Total Revenue by Region: The overall revenue generated within each region, found by summing all sales in that region. This metric is valuable for understanding which regions contribute the most to total revenue.

### TOOLS USED
-------------------------
 - Microsoft Excel: 
    - Pivot Tables: Summarizing data and generating insights based on revenue, units sold, and transaction categories.
    - Formulas and Functions: Calculate performance metrics and automate processes like sorting and filtering.
    - Data Visualizations (Charts, Graphs): To create visual representations of trends, comparisons, and key insights. 

### DATA VISUALIZATION
----------------------------------
 1. ### TOTAL SALES BY PRODUCT

DEDUCTIONS:
-------------------------------------------

  1.  General Total Sales Trajectory: The chart shows a positive upward trend in total sales across different products, indicating that sales are relatively high for certain products and lower for others.
  2.  Product Performance:
       - Shoes have the highest sales, reaching over 600,000 units, making them the most popular product in this dataset.
       - Shirts also perform well, with nearly 500,000 units sold.
       - Hats and Gloves have moderate sales, in the range of 300,000 units.
       - Jackets and Socks have the lowest sales figures, with Jackets slightly outperforming Socks.
  3.   Overall Product Allocation Strategy:
The current allocation suggests prioritizing resources towards high-performing products (Shoes and Shirts) while developing targeted strategies to improve the sales of lower-performing ones (Jackets and Socks).

### CONCLUSION
-------------------------
To maximize revenue, the company should maintain high stock levels and promotional efforts for top-selling items (Shoes and Shirts). For lower-performing products like Jackets and Socks, targeted strategies, such as seasonal promotions or bundling with popular items, may help boost sales. The overall sales trajectory suggests a well-balanced product mix, but improvements in marketing and inventory for underperforming items could enhance total sales performance.


 2. ### TOTAL SALES BY REGION

DEDUCTIONS: 
--------------
  1. General Total Sales by Region Trajectory: The sales trend across regions sharply increased from West to South. Sales in the South region are significantly higher (927,820)     
     compared to the other regions, this region has the highest demand or market penetration.
  2. Product Performance on Total Sales by Region: Although the chart doesnâ€™t break down product performance by region, all products likely have a higher concentration of sales 
     in the South, given their overall share. Lower sales in the West suggest either lower demand across all products or the potential need for stronger marketing or distribution efforts.
  3. Overall Region Allocation Strategy: The current region allocation indicates that the South is the dominant market, and strategies to maintain or further strengthen its share are essential. The East and North regions present moderate performance but show potential for improvement through focused marketing. The West region is the weakest, suggesting the need        for an in-depth evaluation to identify growth opportunities or to consider alternative strategies tailored to this region's market dynamics.

#### CONCLUSION
----------------------------
The South region is the clear leader in sales, making it a critical area for maintaining high inventory and a strong marketing focus. The West regionâ€™s lower performance suggests a need for strategic improvements in market penetration or customer outreach. The East and North regions perform moderately, with potential for growth through targeted campaigns. Overall, focusing on the South while developing tailored strategies for the other regions could help optimize total sales across all markets.
